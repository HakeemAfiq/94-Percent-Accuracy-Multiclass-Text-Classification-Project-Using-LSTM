### Summary
This project is an NLP of BBC news articles which are categorised into one of five categoty which is tech, sport, business, politics and entertainment. This project serves as a practice to get a better understanding on developing an NLP predictions model. The goal is to get atleast a 70% prediction accuracy and an f1 score of above 0.7 for each category which was achieved as can be seen in the classification report below. The architecture of the model is developed by implementing embedding layer and dropout layer into the LSTM layers further improve the performance of the model.
